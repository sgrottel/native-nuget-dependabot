This repository holds synthetic `csproj` files with Nuget dependencies mirrored from other projects, either in private or offline projects, or in native Cpp code `vcxproj` projects.
Those projects cannot be automatically scanned by Dependabot, either for visibility or for feature set:

As [suggested]( https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/8590#issuecomment-1988870679), and similar to [this example]( https://github.com/willbush/dependabot-cpm-updates), this repository hosts proxy projects, which can be scanned by Dependabot.

The content of this repository is very specific to my projects, and it is not really useful by itself.
It's just part of my "updates available reporting setup."
Of course, you can have a look to get inspirations and copies for your own solution to similar problems
