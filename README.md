# Native Nuget Dependabot
Proxy project repository to use dependabot for nuget packages in native cpp projects, incl. private projects, for update reports.

The content of this project is not really useful by itself.
It's just part of my "updates available reporting setup."
Of course, you can have a look to get inspirations and copies for your own solution to similar problems
